# Misc Ideas

This file just contains short little blurbs of ideas I have while out-and-about. Will likely be updated frequently as mechanics move in and out.

---

The players and GM can work together to create the “map” – a list of places in the world that each player can use a minor actor to move to. These don’t have to be at all laid out on an actual map, they can just be a sort of series of nodes that can be visited from any other node.

- Maybe each place on the map has a size level: Kingdom, City, Place of Interest. Each Kingdom has 1d6 cities, each City has 1d6 Places of Interest. The players take turns describing these places in some way.
- Moving to the same node does something, means something, costs something, etc.

---

Have predefined asymmetric characters/kingdoms for each player. Each character/kingdom gets a couple of unique abilities–list of alternate settings in the back can have the set of predefined characters/groups that would exist in that setting and what their unique abilities are.

- Similar to how Alice is Missing and The King’s Dilemma create drama by forcing players into a specific dynamic of characters.
- Does not work with the idea that KITB can be played sidecar with other games?

---

Maybe each pair of kingdoms has a slider representing their relationship with each other. At the end of each round, each Kingdom adjusts the slider based on that round. Actions can also affect the sliders.

- Players will probably just want to max the sliders as quickly as possible. Not sure if that should be rewarded, for the sake of a message of community, or discouraged for the sake of adding conflict to the game.

---

Maybe every round, at least one action taken by each kingdom must involve another kingdom. Like they must ask a question or send something as a gift, etc.

---

Have a section that lists the different module systems the game has and which ones work for each style of play:

- Sidecar
	- Actions that involve sidecar games
- Independent
	- Free worldbuilding
- GM-less
	- Diplomacy-esque map play

---

Maybe this even exists as Basic and Advanced editions. Inspired by the idea that it's becoming more and more difficult to keep this game simple enough for a text chain, while still engaging.

---

Smallville RPG-esque relationship diagram. Have each kingdom describe the relationships they have with the other kingdoms in the game. They must have at least one enemy kingdom.

---

Every time a pair of kingdoms fight over territory, the clock on the Big Threat ticks up. But the kingdoms feel they have to fight because of some resource. Like maybe they have to make a roll at the start of every round to ensure their trackers don't get randomly appointed new values (i.e. a d6 movement in a random direction on each tracker). Or maybe, having their trackers right over the fulcrum means they can take one extra action each round per stable tracker. The Places of Interest in the map give bonuses to trackers, so kingdoms need to fight over them to keep their trackers stable.

---

Have the GM create the map of the world. Put Points of Interest in a number of the provinces for kingdoms to send their troops out and explore (kind of like a fog-of-war system). PoI should have unique benefits.

- Two PoIs are linked portals, allowing instant movement across a large distance.
- Terracotta Army. +1 army unit
- Resource vein. +1 wealth
- Important location to the adventuring party’s quest.
- Dead god.
- Magic weapon.

Each tracker has a **fulcrum**. At the beginning of the game, each fulcrum starts in the middle of the tracker, at zero

Have a separate stat for how large the kingdom is: **Population**. Every point in Population moves the fulcrum of the Might/Wealth tracker to the Wealth side. More food is needed for more mouths to feed; additionally, more population means more people to protect, meaning Might is harder to maintain. This doesn’t fully make sense with the actions, so perhaps the fulcrum for the Might/Wealth tracker represents the minimum Wealth points you need to feed your kingdom at the end of each round–as you get bigger, that minimum gets bigger too. If you don’t meet the minimum, you get some kind of penalty.

Each kingdom starts with the same number of troops. Each point in Might above 0 equates to an extra troop on the world map; conversely each point below 0 is one less troop than the starting number.

Each point above the fulcrum in Prestige gives some kind of mechanical benefit to votes. Maybe each point is a vote, period. If you have points into Infamy, you only have one vote, but you can view the state of the votes before they are revealed? Maybe you can even take away votes equal to the number of Infamy points you have.

Points into Sovereignty gives bonuses to the Discover Something action.

Whenever you choose to view a piece of spoiler text, you take a point into Infamy. Maybe this is an action, something like Reveal a Secret.

Perhaps each round, you randomly roll for a **target** for each of your trackers. You get a benefit if your trackers match your targets at the end of the round. No penalties though.

**Boon**: +1d4/6 to a Kingdom Resource
**Strain**: -d4/6 to a Kingdom Resource

How do we make people want to keep their trackers on the middle line? We give them some kind of benefit when their trackers are right over their fulcrum.

Maybe instead of the trackers being number based, it's just a line of checkpoints. ‘Mark 2 Might’ so you fill in the circle 2 more towards the Might side.
