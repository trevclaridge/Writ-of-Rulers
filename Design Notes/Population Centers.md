# Populace, Population Centers

- Every province your kingdom owns counts as 1 Populace
  - Moves the Wealth/Might fulcrum 1 space towards Wealth
- You can use a project to establish a city in a province.
  - Increases the base strength of that province by one, so units (not of the owning kingdom) must be supported to move into it even if it is currently empty. Units of the owning kingdom can move into it with no special restrictions (still follows usual movement rules)
  - Establishment of a city can decrease/increase Populace by 1
    - decrease if Populace is a penalty
    - increase if Populace is a bonus
