# Kingdom Scales Roll Tables

What does your kingdom have an overabundance of?

1. Food
2. Precious metals
3. Timber

What makes the people of your kingdom unique? Is it something physical or cultural?

1. Everyone is very artistic; so many pieces of art are being produced that cities will commonly have several "works storage" services competing with each other.
2. Citizens only dress in monochromatic clothing; mismatched color clothing is a signal of social rebellion.
3. Society in your kingdom is divided into a number of distinct communities with differing societal functions and cultural aesthetics.
4. Natives of your kingdom have a physical feature of an animal, like a tail, snout, wings, gills, or something else.
5. A majority of the residents in your kingdom were built, grown, hatched, or otherwise created in a way that differs from being born.
6. Inhabitants of your kingdom age slowly or not at all; many citizens have lived very long lives.
