# Player Archetypes

## Johnny

**Summary:** Johnny would be a very active player for a sessioned game, but can't make it on the days his friends play.
**Incentive:** Johnny wants to play because it will allow him to interact with his friends' game in a meaningful way despite his absence at the table.
**Playstyle:** Johnny wants to be in constant communication with his DM and the other kingdoms. He sends replies to messages pretty much as soon as he receives them and is quick to react to world events. Johnny will sometimes write long form fiction in the world of his kingdom to flesh out its history.
**Out-of-Game:** Johnny is an avid fan of nerd culture--movies/tv, books, manga/comics. He's also been reading and watching a lot of content related to roleplaying--actual plays, DM advice, RPG reviews.

## Miranda

**Summary:** Miranda has some experience playing RPGs, but travels a lot and can't commit to any long term sessioned games.
**Incentive:** Miranda still wants to play an RPG, but their love of travel takes precedent. Miranda is attracted to the idea of an RPG that they can play from their phone whenever they get time in their busy schedule.
**Playstyle:** Miranda will well send messages semi-regularly, but will sometimes have long absent periods when they are travelling. Their messages are usually short and to the point, with the occasional flavor.
**Out-of-Game:** Miranda likes to keep up to date with the major media trends, watching the big shows, reading from BookTok, and listening to podcasts. They were introduced to RPGs through actual plays like The Adventure Zone and Dimension 20.

## Shelly

**Summary:** Shelly doesn't know much about RPGs and is playing one for the first time at the behest of the DM.
**Incentive:** Shelly normally wouldn't be interested in RPGs, but was convinced to give this game a try because it promised to let her play only when and as much as she wants to.
**Playstyle:** Shelly logs on once per turn and sends out messages in bulk. Having some experience playing boardgames, she will usually focus on the system and mechanics in place of roleplaying.
**Out-of-Game:** Shelly doesn't have much connection to the roleplaying world at all except for the family member or friend DM that invited her to this game. Their interests are in network tv shows, craft projects, and crime novels.

## Louis

**Summary:** Louis is playing a character in another RPG that this game will play sidecar to.
**Incentive:** Louis' character is a major figure in the game world, so the DM has allowed him to play in the sidecar game, making Louis' character's decisions more impactful.
**Playstyle:** Louis consults with his party on what he should do on each of his kingdom's turns. His messages are fairly frequent and often in-character.
**Out-of-Game:** Louis works with the DM to ensure that the narrative between the sessioned game and this game works smoothly, often allowing the DM to use him to give exposition to the players of either game.
