# Make A Prediction Design

## What should the reward for a correct prediction be?

Some options:

- The ruler could get the action back + 1 more.
  - If prediction adjudication is done at the end of a round, this essentially just means getting 2 extra actions in the new round. Not awful, but very exploitable.
  - If adjudication stays open until the prediction is made true (within a round), the +2 actions during the middle of a round could make for some interesting changes in strategy. Adjudicating puts a little pressure on the DM to be very alert of action use across all kingdoms though, and quick to alert the predicting player of their reward. Doesn't feel like it fits the play-when-you-want format very well.
- The ruler could be allowed to shift a tracker of their choice by a specific number in the direction of their choice. Like +2 to Wealth or Might. I don't see how this really maps thematically though; why would correctly predicting that another kingdom spent an action on sending a delegate let me increase my Wealth stat?
- Just a flat increase to the Infamy stat? It'd be the only mechanic so far that targets one specific stat. (And if I can help it, I'd like to remove the Prestige/Infamy tracker, so this is option isn't ideal.)
