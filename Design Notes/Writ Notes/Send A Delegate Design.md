# Send A Delegate Design Notes

## Group Chats?

This writ initially assumed that kingdoms could start group chats for more than 2 kingdoms at a time, but then I considered the following scenario:

3 kingdoms in a group chat. 1 of the kingdoms of the 3 has only spent 1 writ for one of the other kingdoms, meaning they can't speak to the third kingdom.
Do they just directly reply to the kingdom they can speak to, or do they have to stay silent? They can't speak in the group chat, but they can direct message the kingdom they spent the action for.

## Externally cutting communication lines?

What if rulers could spend an writ to stop two other kingdoms from talking to each other? How would it work? Maybe 1 writ to ensure a single certain pair of kingdoms couldn't speak to each other that turn. How does that work in group chats?
Surely you don't say that a player can exclude another player from chatting entirely.
