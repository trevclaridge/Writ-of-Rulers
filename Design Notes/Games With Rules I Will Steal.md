# Games With Rules I Will Steal

Obviously, when I say "steal," I mean "be inspired by and use." Credit will always be given appropriately.

- Faction Turn by Thomas Manuel (Yes Indie'd) for resource trading
- Diplomacy for combat
- Maybe Clocks from Blades in the Dark for goals
- Diminishing Pools for Projects from Venture
