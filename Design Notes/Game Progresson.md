# Game Progression

## Start of Game

Kingdom and ruler creation. Importantly, players roll for their kingdom's history which will misalign their kingdom trackers. This period also includes learning the rules and setting campaign expectations.

- kingdom/ruler creation
- kingdom history rolls, misaligning Kingdom Trackers
- learn rules and set campaign expectations

## Early Game

Players will spend most of their writs exploring the map, learning what each lies at each Landmark and expanding their borders. Players will also be encouraged to have their rulers introduce themselves to each other via the Send a Delegate writ. Players might also start some projects to deal with their misaligned Kingdom Trackers

- start exploring and charting the map
- introduce themselves to other players
- start projects to fix Kingdom Trackers

## Mid Game

At this point, most players will have most of their map filled in, noting the benefits of all available Landmarks. Using this info, players might start creating cities in close by provinces to gain a stronger control of their local Landmarks and the surrounding areas. During this period in the game, players will have a little more freedom to choose their kingdom's destiny; depending on the tone of the game, players might focus on building trusting relationships with other kingdoms, or they might instead continue to try to realign their Kingdom Trackers--this could put them into conflict with other kingdoms vying for the same strategically-valuable Landmarks. Choices made in the early game would echo in this period.

- build relationships with other kingdoms
- conflict with other kingdoms
- use projects and Landmarks to fix Kingdom Trackers
- address lingering consequences from Early Game decisions

## Late Game

The formal introduction of a large threat shakes up the game and makes players reconsider any alliances or conflicts they might have made during the Early and Late Game. Players will use their knowledge of the world and the other kingdoms at play to find a way to address the Big Threat and ensure their own kingdom's survival. Players might see their Kingdom Trackers drastically change and will need to take dramatic action in order to stabilize them, perhaps even increasing their usage of the Make a Big Play writ.

- introduction of the Big Threat
- re-evaluate alliances and conflicts
- take dramatic action to fix Kingdom Trackers

## End Game

The winding down of the Big Threat and a return to relative peace. Any outstanding projects are brought to a close and their effects crystalized in history. Players are encouraged to describe their ruler's retirement if their ruler/kingdom still lives. Players may also choose to have their ruler end in a less fortunate way if the narrative calls for it.

- projects are ended
- rulers retire or are otherwise removed from office

## Post Game

A general debrief of the whole campaign. Players are encouraged to message freely about the game, discussing how certain events turned out as well as brainstorming the resolution of any loose ends that may occur in the narrative.

- debrief
- brainstorm loose ends resolutions
