# Misc Writ of Rulers Mood Notes

- Hard rules vs soft rules
- Don't leave other players behind by posting a ton.
- Talk to your table, aka, if you know you'll have to step away from the game for an extended period, tell the group so that aren't left feeling ghosted
- Out-of-character text channel in discord
- Variable minor actions and major actions for real life stuff (somehow have a pretty free week, extra actions--busy week, save actions for later)
- Is the game between the players with a dm referee or between players and a dm independently?
- Initiative systems are important:
 	- Strict orders are difficult for PBP
- Need to figure out some safety tools. Not sure how they would work for play by post.
- A sullen king standing alone and hunched in front of a massive stain glass window that depicts them standing proud, confident, and royal.
 	- Cover art?
 	- Maybe the hobbled, sullen king is actually watching the construction of the proud stain glass window. That way it doesn't imply that the stain glass window is just of the king when he was younger, but that it is actively telling a lie about how king's mood.
