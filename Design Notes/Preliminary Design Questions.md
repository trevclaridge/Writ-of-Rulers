# Preliminary Design Questions

## What do I want players to do?

- negotiate
- form alliances
- world-build their kingdom
  - discover new things
  - create landmarks
  - play NPCs
  - create/write important events
- help players of a side-car game (or hinder them)

## What do I want player to want?

- I want players to want to protect the people of their kingdom. I want them to actually care about their kingdom's wellbeing.
- I want players to have a goal for their kingdom, and I want them to be able to take actions to meet that goal.
- I want players to be interested in the events of the larger world.
- I want players to want to talk to other kingdoms. They should need to create alliances and rely on other kingdoms to meet their goals.

## How do I want players to feel?

- powerful: their decisions should have real consequences at a larger scale
- important: they should be looked up to, and they should feel as though they *own* something that is uniquely theirs and they're in charge of
- responsible/stressed: they should always be making hard choices; it can be difficult for them to reach their goals as they are always side-tracked by their ruling responsibilities.

## What do I not want?

- I don't want players to ever have to wait for another player's turn before they can continue to play. Everyone should be able to play asynchronously without any issues.
- I don't want players to ever feel punished for how much (how little) they can post to the game. Players should be entirely allowed to invest time/effort as they can in their busy life schedules.
- I don't want players to feel as though they have to play any specific way to have fun. Politics might be fun for some, but those who just want to have a fun little kingdom to play in are just as valid.
- I don't want any potential player to feel too intimidated to join because of lack of roleplaying experience. Rules should be simple to learn and easy to remember.
