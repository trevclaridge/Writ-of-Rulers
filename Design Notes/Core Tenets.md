# Core Tenets

1. Players play kingdoms, not characters.
2. Games can be played synchronously or asynchronously.
	- Asynchronous games can be played online over instant messenger.
3. A game of Writ of Rulers can be bolted on to another TTRPG campaign.
	- Meant for players who can’t commit to weekly sessions and aren’t in the core party, but still want to interact with the game.
4. Writ of Rulers uses a simple, easy to learn ruleset that encourages creativity.

## Tones/Themes/Emphasises

1. Political intrigue
2. Sociological, not psychological
3. Nation building
	- Size dependent. Could be building actual buildings to get bonuses, or could be abstract like settling certain areas, raising armies, and hiring key personnel.
