- Discussion of size
	- Make sure your kingdom/faction/city has enough people to still be referred to by the collective name.
	- Kingdoms take their turn as one massive entity. Try to avoid paying too close attention to a kingdomâ€™s ruler, president, etc. They may give the orders in the fiction of the world, but it is the kingdom at large that takes the game actions. It is what the kingdom does, not what the ruler of the kingdom said to do.
