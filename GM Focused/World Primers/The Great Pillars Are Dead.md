# The Great Pillars Are Dead

## The Mysteries

- The Great Pillars are dead.
  - Obelisks that once channeled magic. We used to use them for communication; we could send messages across vast distances. Now they lay dormant, severing our nations' correspondence.
- The Tangle blocks passage in the north.
  - A over-dense forest. Trees climb over each other to get at the light--the lowest layers have not seen illumination for millennia. Those who venture into the undergrowth do not return.
- The world of dreams seeps into the world of the waking.
  - People all over have been experiencing strange dreams. Images of what's to come perhaps, or manifestations?

## The Details

- This is a low fantasy world. Magic was once abundant, but has for the most part departed from the world. Magic will come up over the course of play, and players are encouraged to suggest magical effects and/or events in use of their Writs, just keep in mind magic is a rare thing for most people of this world.
- This game will be medieval-inspired in terms of technology level and themes. Swords, horses, knights in armor, banners and crests, all the like. Very Game Of Thrones inspired.
