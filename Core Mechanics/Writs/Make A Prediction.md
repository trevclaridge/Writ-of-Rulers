# Make A Prediction

*Read the whole board. Don't react, anticipate. This writ allows rulers to combine their immense cunning and the knowledge they've gathered of their neighboring kingdoms to form well-calculated bets on those neighbors' next moves.*

Rulers can spend their writs to make educated guesses as to how other rulers will allocate their own writs. At the cost of 1 writ per prediction, rulers may send a message to the GM naming a kingdom and detailing how they believe that kingdom will spend one of their writs.

At the end of the round, the GM will inform the ruler which, if any, of their predictions were correct. For each correct prediction, the ruler gets an additional writ for use in the next round. Incorrect predictions provide no benefits.
