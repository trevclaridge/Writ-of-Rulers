# Make A Big Play

*Sacrifices are the payment for a new destiny. This writ gives rulers the opportunity to spend all of the writs for a round at once to change the status quo of reality.*

When a ruler feels that the way of the world simply must change in order for their kingdom to thrive, they can make a **big play**. A big play in WoR is representative of a dramatic and historic event that will impact the way of life in all the kingdoms of the world for the foreseeable future. Examples of some big plays in fiction are: the destruction of the Shield Wall in *Dune*, the declaration of the King in the North in *A Song of Ice and Fire*, or the recovery of the Urca gold in *Black Sails*. To make a big play, a ruler must spend all of the writs they have access to for the round, including writs earned or saved from a previous round. Rulers are expected to communicate and work with the GM to detail out the effects of a proposed big play might be, noting things like: how it might physically manifest in the game world, how it benefits the ruler and kingdom who makes the big play, and how it might affect other kingdoms going forward. After communicating with the GM, the ruler who made the big play should make a post in the World Events text channel describing the event; a GM can optionally follow-up with a message detailing any mechanical or thematic changes the big play might imply.

Big plays are best used if a ruler finds themself low on writs for a round, either from an unlucky starting roll, or a number of compounded issues relating to their kingdom’s Kingdom Resources. Sacrificing a relatively low number of writs all at once for a huge societal change can sometimes be more effective to achieving a ruler’s objective than parsing out writs individually to other actions.
