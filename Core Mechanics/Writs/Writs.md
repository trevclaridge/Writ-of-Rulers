# Writs

Attention and time are important commodities to a ruler in the throws of governing as one can only focus on a number of pressing issues at a time. A good ruler must learn to balance their limited resources and prioritize the most urgent matters--more than a trivial feat when all affairs start to feel equally serious. In an effort to simulate a ruler's need to adapt to the natural fluctuations of the political landscape, rulers are limited to a number of **writs** per round which they will need to budget against their plethora of critical projects.  

Writs represent the basic steps and procedures fundamental to running a kingdom. Opening communication channels with other kingdoms, advancing internal agendas, and commanding the movement of military forces are all examples of writs a ruler might take in their administrative duties. These and other core writs will be described here, but players can appeal to the GM at any point with an action they would like their ruler to take, at which point it is in GM's discretion to assign an writ cost to the proposal or describe how that action may not be possible in the fiction of the world.

At the start of every round, players will roll a die to determine how many writs their ruler may take that round; the result of the die roll + 1 is the number of writs the ruler has at their disposal for the upcoming round. Additionally, rulers may take 1 extra writ for each of their resource trackers they had balanced over their fulcrums at the end of the previous round.

Writs not used by the end of a round are lost, though some special circumstances or rules may allow unused writs to roll over between rounds.
