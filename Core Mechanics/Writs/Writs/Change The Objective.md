# Change The Objective

*New perspectives come from the turns of the tide. This writ allows rulers to adapt to the shifting landscape by declaring a new objective for their kingdom.*

Rulers may spend 1 writ to change their objective during the course of a round. They may only do this once per round and it must not be the final writ they spend that round.
