# Send A Delegate

*Break bread, not bones. This writ simulates the difficulty long distances can pose on communication. Rulers must spend their valuable writs to open communication channels with other kingdoms each turn.*

Two kingdoms must not directly message or otherwise privately communicate unless each kingdom has spent a writ to send a political delegate to personally meet with a representative of the other kingdom looking to converse. The cost of 1 writ opens commutation with one specific kingdom; if two kingdoms wish to speak to one another, each of them must spend 1 writ to speak to the other. Once the requisite writs have been spent on both sides, the involved kingdoms are free to open a private chat in which to conspire.

Once communications channels have been opened, they stay open until the end of round; should the scheming rulers wish to continue their whispering, they must spend the requisite writs again at the start of the next round.

Rulers may still interact with each other in public chats, like those of the World Events, Marketplace, and Spy Network, without needing to spend a writ (unless otherwise directed for writs specific to those public chats).
