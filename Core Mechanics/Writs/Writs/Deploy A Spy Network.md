# Deploy A Spy Network

*I hear with your ears, I look with your eyes. This writ allows rulers to surveil and interfere with other kingdoms via a web of secret operatives.*

With this writ, rulers can embed covert agents into other kingdoms in an effort to stealthily influence them or gain their crucial tactical information. To deploy a spy network, a ruler must spend 3 writs and designate a target kingdom other than their own. This spy network will then enter that kingdom with a **heat** level of 1. Heat is representative of how aware the target kingdom is of the spy network’s meddling of affairs.

Once a spy network has been established, a ruler can invoke it in one of three ways:

1. To learn how the target kingdom has spent one of their writs during the current round. Rulers can spend 1 writ and specify a writ by name (e.g. Change the Objective, Order a Unit, Send a Delegate, etc.); the GM tells the ruler whether the target kingdom has used the chosen writ during the current turn and provides additional details where necessary. For example, if the chosen writ is Order a Unit, the GM indicates which unit is being ordered and what their order is. If the chosen writ is Send a Delegate, the GM provides the name of the kingdom to which the delegate has been sent.
For each writ spent on this option, the spy network’s heat level increases by 1, to a maximum of 6.
2. To push a single Resource Tracker of the target kingdom in a chosen direction by 1. Rulers can spend 1 writ and indicate a specific Resource of the target kingdom; that Resource increases by 1.
For each writ spent on this option, the spy network’s heat level increases by 3, to a maximum of 6.
3. To lay low and decrease the spy network’s heat level. Rulers can spend 1 writ to lower the spy network’s heat level by 1, to a minimum of 1. Rulers can choose to invoke this option as many times as they please during each round.

Once a spy network has made its way into a target kingdom, it can remain there, providing intelligence and a means of manipulation, for as long as it can remain hidden from the target kingdom. For the cost of 1 writ, any ruler can attempt to rout out a spy network in their kingdom. The ruler rolls a d6–if the roll is less than or equal to the spy network’s heat level, the network is unmasked and can no longer be invoked. A ruler can create a new spy network by taking this writ again, but the writ cost is increased by 1 for each previously revealed network.
