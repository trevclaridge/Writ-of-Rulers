# Sidecar

Actually the original motivation for making this game, sidecar play means bolting *Writ of Rulers* onto another roleplaying game (or games) in an effort to make a more dynamic game world. The rules that mention sidecar play will refer to a “sidecar game”, which is a term we will use to describe an active campaign of a traditional session-based game that you can play *Writ of Rulers* alongside. In sidecar play, two campaigns run in parallel: one to describe the actions and developments of an ensemble cast of characters, and another to facilitate the ever-changing environments and politics and of the world the ensemble characters live in. Put another way, while games like *Dungeons and Dragons* or *Mothership* allow players to control the protagonists of a story, a sidecar game of *Writ of Rulers* has players controlling the setting of that same story. As a party of adventurers makes their way across a vast fictional landscape, they may encounter obstacles put in their way by this game.

The main conceit of this format of play is that it opens an avenue to still have a meaningful connection and impact on a group’s campaign without being an active participant at the table–this is written specifically for the friends and family who want to take part in the roleplaying, but who can’t commit to a regular schedule of meeting up for the campaign sessions.
