# Standalone

Playing standalone just means using the rules entirely on their own and separate from any other material. While using outside resources is entirely possible (and encouraged), the rules designed to standalone play don’t assume that you are using anything but the rules written here. In contrast with sidecar play, the standalone format also doesn’t expect you to be playing *Writ of Rulers* side-by-side with any other roleplaying games.
