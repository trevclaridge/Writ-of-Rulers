# Evalute Success Of Objective

At the end of the round, each ruler should take a moment to look back at all they have accomplished. Did their labors bear fruits? Did they spend their resources effectively? Did they achieve their objective? Rulers should refer to their most recent objective, be it the one they decided on at the beginning of the round, or one they pivoted to via the Change the Objective writ, and decide whether or not they met its requirements.
