# Objectives

*Plans within plans.*

It is the job of the ruler to create the big picture plan of action for the whole kingdom, to point out the target in the future for which the people will strive. At the beginning of each round, each ruler should declare an **objective** that they wish to achieve by the end of the round. The exact nature of an objective is intentionally left vague so that rulers can flex creativity in coming up with interesting and unique goals their kingdom can endeavor towards over the course of the round. Some examples may be: “I intend to bring my Wealth/Might tracker to balance,” or, “I want to learn more about the mysterious Cult of Violet that has been gaining followers from among my citizens.” At the end of the round, it will be up to the ruler to decide whether or not the objective was completed successfully, at which point a suitable reward will be available to the kingdom (more on that in the section entitled Evaluate Success of Objective).
