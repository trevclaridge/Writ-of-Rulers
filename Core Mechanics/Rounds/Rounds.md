# Rounds

This roleplaying community is filled with *individuals*, that is to say, real people with real lives. Your lives are complex, unique, and often, full. This is a significant problem for this hobby that so regularly demands large time commitments from people who are Busy with a capital b, manifesting in the lamented scheduling issues that kills so many sure-to-be-wonderful campaigns. The goal of the system in*Writ of Rulers* is to appeal to busy players with a chance to engage with a form of collaborative storytelling without the need to make any serious time commitments. Instead, players in *Writ of Rulers* play at their own pace, performing the functions of the game whenever they want during a wide period of real life time; this period is referred to as a **round**.

There are no *turns*, there are no real *sessions*, instead the rounds in *Writ of Rulers* are played over any agreed upon interval of time. A round could be 1 week, 1 month, 1 day, 10 minutes, or anywhere in between. The round can be any amount of time so long as it gives players enough buffer to finish all the things they want to do in the game during that round, while still being able to live out their busy schedules and not feel pressured by a ticking clock.
