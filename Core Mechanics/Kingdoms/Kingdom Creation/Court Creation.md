# Court Creation

To fill out your court, describe 3 people with whom you interact daily. For each courtier, answer the following questions:

1. What are their name and pronouns?
2. What is their relationship to you?
3. What is their relationship to your kingdom?
4. What is an important memory you have with them?

Choose one of the following questions to answer for each of your courtiers:

1. What is something you and this courtier disagree on?
2. What is something this courtier is attempting that you think is destined to fail?
3. What is a terrible act you've learned this courtier performed in their past?
